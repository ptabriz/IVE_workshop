# IVE Workshop 

## Introduction 
The intent of this section is to introduce professional and consumer-friendly cameras using in image acquisition. For professional cameras, setting up and capturing image with Gigapan Epic Pro will be explained and Nikon KeyMission 360, as a consumer camera, will be briefly described. A table also has been provided to compare some other consumer cameras in market.   

### i.	Sources for Skybox Images

Skybox is a very important component of VR. It is a sphere of imagery which gives an “illusion of depth and reality”. Three common sources of skybox image are cylindrical panorama, spherical panorama, and 3D cube panorama. 

*	Cylindrical Panoramas
Cylindrical panorama is very similar to regular panorama, except in this type of panorama, the camera rotates completely 360° along a horizontal axis. Because of the movement of objects, sometimes you will see inevitable misalignments or inconsistencies in the produced image. Also, as a result of the nature of cylindrical capturing, some of the top and bottom elements might be missed. There are some ways to partially correct these errors when they are stitched, but their results are not always graceful. Consequently, cylindrical panoramas are fine but they are not perfect when you want to capture every detail of all directions.

*	Spherical Panoramas
Spherical panoramas are the best fit in VR scene in terms of displaying details of all directions. Both expensive high quality cameras and consumer-friendly devices use this method to capture full sphere panoramic image. 
There are various ways to create a full 360° horizontally x180° vertically equirectangular panorama. Some mobile apps capture a series of photos at different angles and stitch it into an equirectangular pano to make a full spherical panorama. Even, you can recreate a spherical panorama from a series of normal DSLR photos if they have been taken tactically in advance. 
It is always a chance for an object to move during a spherical panorama capturing. Also when you don’t use tripod, rotating around a center point without moving is challenging. As a result, there might be anomalies in spherical panoramas. 

*	3D Cube Panoramas
3D Cube Panoramas is the best method for creating VR scenes with 3D artwork made with a modeling software such as Blender. However, it works fine with photos too. To that end, six cameras need to be set up, each at a 90° rotation to one another, in the center of the location. Each camera will take photos at the same time to capture all six side of a 3D cube.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

>`sample code snippet ` 
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
